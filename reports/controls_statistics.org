* Preface

* Stochastic Steps (previous version)
Number of chains per beads, $Nc$, normalized length for end-capping, $l_c$.
** Visiting random beads
The visit probability is identical: that means we visit particles with probability $1/Np$, where $Np$ is number of particles. 

** Selecting chains
Each chains has probability that depends on the tension exerted on the chains:
\begin{equation}
P'(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j) = \beta_0\exp\left((k_BT)^{-1}F(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j)l_c\right),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_0$ is given parameters that related with detachment frequency:
\begin{equation}
\beta_0 = \Omega \exp(-E_B/k_BT),
\end{equation}
which depth of energy wall, $E_B$, controls that chain keeps the attached status.

The suggested probability is normalized by partition function for visited beads, $Z_k$:
\begin{equation}
Z_k = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{ce}}\beta_0\exp\left((k_BT)^{-1}F(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_{\mathscr{C}_k(\mathbf{r}_i)})l_c\right),
\end{equation}
where $\mathscr{C}_k(\mathbf{r}_i)$ is the position vectors for other chain ends of $\mathbf{r}_i$.


# Note that the barrier energy $E_B$ affect to $\beta_0$ which is canceled out since this is constant variables both of denominator and numerator. So, the normalized probability is NOT affected by the barrier energy.



** Action of selected chain ends
At the moment, the behaviour for selected chain ends follows Boltzmann distribution of the potential exerted on the chain:
\begin{equation}
p_k(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j) = \exp\left(-(k_BT)^{-1}U(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_j)\right),
\end{equation}
where $U$ is potential exerted on the chains which is function of the distance between each chain ends, $|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|$.

* Stochastic Steps (revised version)
The proposed scheme using normalized probability distribution with $Z_k$ that cancels out the effect of energy barrier. On this regards, there is no role from it which results in increasing flux to association. In addition, the visiting the chain ends that has the highest energy more frequently while the visiting opportunity to other chains becomes lower and lower. 

*** Selecting subjected chain end
Let assumed that the selecting chain ends is in random, i.e., we are specifying the visiting chain ends as 
\begin{equation}
P_{i,k} = \frac{1}{2*Nc*Np}.
\end{equation}
*** Transition state: Active or Passive
In any visiting status, we have to decide the subjected chain end is in transition state or not. The meaning of chain end is in transition state is that it detached from previously attached bead, and waiting decision for next action. Let 'active' be the transition state while 'passive' be the remained state. 

**** Roof chain 
Consider the selected chain end attached the same bead with the opposite side of chain ends, which is called roof chain. In this case, the transition probability from passive to active is controlled by energy barrier to detachment, $E_B$. Let assumed that transition probability is given by Boltzmann factor:
\begin{equation}
\pi_{P\to A} \equiv \frac{\exp\left(-(k_BT)^{-1}E_B\right)}{\exp(0)} = \exp\left(-(k_BT)^{-1}E_B\right) (\equiv \tilde{\beta}_0)
\end{equation}

**** Associated chain
If the subject chain ends is associate state, i.e., opposite side of chain end attached to other beads, the tension exerted on the chain help to transition from passive to active state. With the same notation for the detachment frequency, we have
\begin{equation}
\pi_{P\to A} = \exp\left(-(k_BT)^{-1}\left(E_B - Fl_c\right)\right) (\equiv \tilde{\beta} = \tilde{\beta}_0\exp(Fl)),
\end{equation}
where $F$ is tension exerted on the chain and $l_c$ is length for end-capping.

**** Metropolis Algorithm
Notice that whenever $Fl_c$ larger than $E_B$, the transition probability higher than unity. Similar to the Metropolis algorithm, we are applying always acceptance state for the transition:
\begin{equation}
\pi_{P\to A} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} \exp\left(-(k_BT)^{-1}\left(E_B - Fl_c\right)\right), & E_B > Fl_c \\
1, & \textrm{otherwise} \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}




**** Connectivity Information
First of all, the following description is related with generalization the transition probability matrix with newly developed scheme. However, the internal information change effect to the system, which means the it cannot be the independent probability that handling components-wise in the matrix form. At this moment, the basic approach will following the previously described manner with the existing stochastic method. Even if the following description will not applied at this moment, it is worth to develop transition probability that describe the whole information for association/dissociation kinetics. 

Let $\mathscr{C}_{i,j}$ be the number of connections between i-th and j-th particles, the connectivity matrix is given by 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \left[\mathscr{C}_{i, j}\right]\qquad i,\,j\in [1, N_p].
\end{equation}
Let $\pi_{i,j}$ be transition probability to connect between i-th and j-th particle:
\begin{equation}
\pi_{i,j} = \pi^{i}_{P\to A}P_{i,j},
\end{equation}
where $\pi^{i}_{P\to A}$ is transition probability from passive to active for i-th particle and $P_{i,j}$ is action probability between i-th and j-th particle.
On this regards, we can define transition matrix
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\Pi} = \left[\pi_{i,j}\right]\qquad i,\,j\in [1, N_p]
\end{equation}



*** Action of selected chain ends
This follows the previous versions.

* The differences with the previous version (originally expected)
Even if the physical meaning differ from the previous version, the consequence of probability map is not so much changes. The flux to detachment, however, is controlled by energy barrier, $E_B$, it is expected that the flux to detach for roof chain decreases while the flux to detach for associated chain increases. In consequence, energy barrier is no more ignorance variable, which is differ from the previous version since the normalized selecting probability in previous version canceled out the energy barrier effect. 

For better understanding, let assumed there are only one chain is associated for given bead while the other chains (say 9) are roof, the probability for the previous map is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{old, i(association)} = \frac{\exp(Fl_c)}{9 + \exp(Fl_c)}.
\end{equation}
When we have cumulating $P_{old}$ in terms of index, we have the maps for selecting probability. 
Even if we do not think about this way, this scheme is physically the same with that /we are visiting chain with equal-probable, and have transition probability from passive to active state with $P_{old}$/. In this sense, the probability to select chain (that automatically in active state) follows figure [[fig:selection_probability]].

In the revised version with Metropolis algorithm, this is not the case. The meaning will be similar with the previous sentence but have different probability:
\begin{equation}
P_{i(association)} = \Pi_{P\to A},
\end{equation}
which shows figure [[fig:transition_probability]] as example. Notice that the meaning for the figure [[fig:selection_probability]] and [[fig:transition_probability]] is different.

* The real difference
In conclusion, there is no real effect from energy barrier to the flux balance between association and dissociation. The results are described on the figure [[fig:effect_energy_barrier]], which shows that three distinguishable regime: (i) initially decreasing, (ii) plateau region, and (iii) decreasing further. Increasing number of trial, however, reveals that the (iii) region is artificial and the number of associations in the (iii) will reach the values of plateau region (ii). This strongly suggested that if we have number of trials, we have just two regions: (i) initially decreasing and (ii) plateau region, which seems to be stationary state.

** Reason for the poor statistics for the region (iii)
This is due to the fact that Metropolis algorithm is NOT efficiency to go through the energy barrier. This is frequently happens in many Monte Carlo simulations. In this case, /important sampling/ is needed to have unbiased statistics. 

** Reason for decreasing number of associations for the region (i)


** Explanations for the similar stationary values between energy barrier scheme and previously used methods
In principle, the energy barrier is just way to determine it is active or not. Number of association is the consequence of balance between flux to attach to its originate bead and flux to attach to other bead, which is determined by
