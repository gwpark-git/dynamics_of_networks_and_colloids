* Identification for MC Equilibration
** Current scheme
Define
\begin{equation}
C_{NAS}(1,n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} N_{A},
\end{equation}
where $N_{A}$ is number of association for the current state. The identification function is based on the differentation of the block averaged case:
\begin{equation}
N_{diff}(n) = \left|\frac{1}{n}C_{NAS}(1,n) - \frac{1}{n-n_b}C_{NAS}(1,n_b)\right|,
\end{equation}
where $n_b$ is number of steps for each block and the identification happens when $n\% n_b = 0$. In addition, the normalization factor is choose by the maximum of $N_{diff}$, which is the identifier compared with the given tolerance for association.


** Renewal scheme
Let $N$ be the number of all associable chains in the system and $n_b$ is number of steps for each block that prevent fluctuation. The identifier is given by
\begin{equation}
I'_{A}(n)=\frac{1}{n_b}\left|C_{NAS}(n-n_b, n) - C_{NAS}(n-2n_b, n-n_b)\right|,
\end{equation}
which means the differentiation of block-averaged number of association compared with the previous step.
Then the identifier in ratio form becomes
\begin{equation}
I_{A}(n) = \frac{I'_{A}(n)}{N},
\end{equation}
that is the ratio between the averaged fluctuation between blocks and total number of associable chains. With simple test condition in 2D (25 associable chains per beads with 640 beads on the system, $N=16,000$), it is appropriate to set the tolerance with 0.001.

# For given stochastic step, $n$, the identification based on the its average differentiation with respect to $n$:
# \begin{equation}
# N_{diff} = \frac{|\Delta N_{A}|}{\Delta n},
# \end{equation}
# where $N_{A}$ is current number of state.
