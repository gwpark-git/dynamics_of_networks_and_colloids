The given evolution equation for the previous set is described on
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\zeta}\left(\sum_{i\in\mathscr{C}_k} \mathbf{F}^{(c)}(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_k) + \sum_i \mathbf{F}^{(r)}(\mathbf{r}_i, \mathbf{r}_k) + \mathbf{F}^{(s)}(\mathbf{r}_k)\right),
\end{equation}
where the information for $\mathscr{C}_k$ for all k in $[0, N_p]$ is already measured during stochastic steps.

In this case, we can think that the time is passing during Brownian update while the stochastic step can be regarded infinite for each Brownian update.

Since the equation evolve Brownian time, we can choose the characteristic time step as
\begin{equation}
t_c = \frac{\zeta}{k_BT}R_0^2,
\end{equation}
where $R_0$ is micell dimension, and the characteristic length is given by $R^m_0$.
