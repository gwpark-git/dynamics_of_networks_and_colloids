* Preface
This article is related with the effect of inheritance, and judgement for equilibration parameters in order to remove violate happens to the statistical results.

* Statistical Difference for Inheritance of Association
Measuring the statistics based on the [[file:ident_MC_equilibrium.org][identification of stochastic steps]] shows that there are statistical difference between /inheritance/ and /renewal/ scheme. This is the driving force to study the reason of the differences, and the conclusion is that /inheritance/ scheme is statistical rich in comparison with /renewal/ scheme. The details are described in below.

The information of association have been reset during time evolution, and newly generated based on new time step. However, for the sufficiently small time step, the trajectory changes are quite minor which means we do not have to reset all the topological information but inherit the previous association information. This can be boost up the computation because it reduced the stochastic steps during computation.

For instance, the 2D test with 640 particles in $40^2$ box with 0.005 tolerance and 1000 iteration blocks makes approximately $10^4$ to $10^5$ orders for each iteration step when renewal is turned on. In this case, the stochastic step that affect to the each time step is reset, which means the average stochastic step for each time step is described by $\langle I(t) \rangle_t$ where $I(t)$ is stochastic iteration number for given time step, which is approximately $10^5$ in the renewal approach.

In the case for inheritance, the $I(t_0)$ is the same with the renwal steps, but the $I(t)$ for $t>t_0$ make much lower values around 2000 and 3000. Say 2000 in averaged value, the effective stochastic steps is described by sum over all stochastic iterations:
\begin{equation}
E(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N_t}I(t_k) = I(t_0) + N_t\langle I(t)\rangle _{t>t_0} \approx 10^5 + N_t\times 10^3.
\end{equation}
It is noteworthy that the equilibrium time step typically higher than 10000, which means the order of magnitude for effective stochastic steps becomes at least 7, which is much higher than the renewal steps. Figure [[fig:compare_statistical_poor_NAS.png]] shows that the statistics of renewal scheme approaches to the statistics of inheritance during increasing the iteration number for stochastic step, which is the evidence for poor statistics for renewal scheme.


* Time steps
It is of importance to know how many topological generation should be involved during time evolution. The default time step for pure Brownian motion given by 0.001 in dimensionless time, and the potential for connectors and repulsion decreases this value but the effects comes from repulsion higher than that of connector. If we recall the characteristic time for our simulation:
\begin{equation}
t_c = \frac{\zeta R_0^2}{k_BT}\frac{1}{C},
\end{equation}
which means the characteristic time is inversely proportial to the repulsion coefficient. Therefore, our time step becomes 0.001 divided by dimensionless repulsive coefficient. For 100, we have 0.00001, for 5900, we have 0.001/5900 which approximately $1.69\times 10^7$, which means we generate unity dimensionless time with time step $10^7$ which is enough to produce topological changes. It is noteworthy that the unity does not means that the average dissipation is related with its size of bead, but $C$ times of size of bead.
