* Scale factor for RMS of end-to-end distance for associable chain
The characteristic distance of the system is given by $R^{M}_0$ that is diameter of micelle. By default, the associable chain properties also used the same characteristic distance:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{R^{M}_0}.
\end{equation}
This is oversimplification since we do not have the direct connections between diameter of micelle and root-mean-square of end-to-end vector for associable chain: $R^{C}_0 = \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{R}^{C}\cdot\mathbf{R}^{C}\rangle}$. 
Since the characteristic distance of system is already given by $R^{M}_0$, it will convenience to use additional scaling factor $\alpha$, $\alpha R^{C}_0 = R^{M}_0$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{U(\mathbf{r})}{k_BT} = \frac{N_D}{2}\left(\frac{r}{R^{C}_0}\right)^2 = \frac{N_D}{2}\left(\frac{r}{\alpha R^{M}_0}\right)^2 = \frac{N_D}{2\alpha^2}\tilde{\mathbf{r}}^2.
\end{equation}

* Effects of Scaling factor


* Temp
Using characteristic length scale as dimeter of micelle, $R_0$, the dimensionless potential becomes
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}(\tilde{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}) = \frac{N_D}{2}\tilde{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{R_0}
\end{equation}

If the length scales for associable chain differ from length scale of diameter of micelle, we have new scale factor $\lapha$ for the dimensionless distance:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{r}}' = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{\alpha R_0}
\end{equation}
Since we still using characteristic distance as $R_0$, we have
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{r}}'}{\alpha}
\end{equation}
Therefore, we have
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}(\tilde{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}) = \frac{N_D}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{\alpha}\right)^2
\end{equation}
